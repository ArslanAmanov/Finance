Micro & Macro Economics 
Microeconomics: 
For example: College tuition is a good example of a microeconomic topic, 
Healthcare policy debate, The housing boom and bust, Income distribution(top1%) 

Macro Economics: 
For examples: Recession of 2007-09 and not so great recovery for US economy, 
Economic growth of China vs Africa , Monetary policy and inflation in the US, 
Fiscal debate in the US, The Euro crisis, The role of the IMF in the world economy,  

GDP (Gross Domestic Product): 
GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given year. 

If you look at the projections of the Congressional Budget Office either in 2009 or more 
recently, it's very similar. If we ever got to that point in the US those high debt levels 
they'd be so high we couldn't possibly service them. We would have to default. 
US is not US anymore. So this is a big issue the macroeconomists are worried about. 

The massive financial crisis in US and other parts of the world 2008-09, 
Which had to do with behavior of financial firms, that's kind of a microeconomic issue. 
But the fact that it spread to the entire economy and the entire world, 
That's a macroeconomic issue. 
It's also had to with the Federal Reserve which can conclude as macroeconomic issue.
