Income Statement: Most people refers to PNL >>> Profit & Loss 
If you want to summarize this PNL: Sales(Revenue)-Costs(Expenses)=Profit  
Total Revenue which is refers to Sales. Many CEO will also call this line their TOP LINE because
it's the top line with PNL. The bottom line is NET INCOME which is also referred to as PROFIT. 
As you look at net income, of course you would like to be higher, and there are really two levers to do that. 
One is to increase the company's Total Revenue and other options would be to DECREASE the company's COST
 

### 
I'd now like to show you what I would do if I only had a minute to analyze it.
Here are the things that I would do.
First, I would look at the company's total revenue and see how it was growing year over year.

Revenue Growth : Year Over Year >> Formula (Period Revenue/Prior Period Revenue - 1) * 100 
year 2012 Revenue = 8300 
year 2011 Revenue = 7200 
(8300/7200-1)*100 = 15% 

Net Income Growth: Year Over Year >>> Formula(Period Net Income/Prior Period Net Income - 1)*100 
year 2012 Net Income = 1087 
year 2011 Net Income = 851 
(1087/851-1)*100 = 28%  

Net Profit Margin: Formula(Net Income/Total Revenue)*100 
Year 2012 Net Income=1087 
year 2012 Total Revenue= 8300 
(1087/8300)*100 = 13% 

Start Up Company : More focused on growing sales than bottom line profit. Build customer base 
Mature Company : Ideally profits grow faster than sales. Great management team able to grow the company 
> Economies of scale 
> Increasing efficiencies 
> Increasing profits  

Expense Line 
1) Cost of Goods Sold: > Raw materials, Direct Labor, Variable Costs 
2) Operating Expenses(Fixed Costs): > Research development, sales & marketing, general & administrative(focus attention),
   depreciation and amortization= Sum all > Operating Expense.  
3) Operating Income : CEO will call is EBIT which stands 
   (Earnings Before Interest & Tax). Interest Income, Interest Expense, Income before provision for income taxes 
   Provision for income taxes.
